<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

'Water Ð¡onsumption Tracker' app to track daily water intake made as a final
project on [GOIT](https://goit.global)
[Fullstack Bootcamp](https://goit.global/ua/courses/bootcamp/) course.

This project is a web application for managing personal water consumption within
daily limits, allowing users to track their water intake throughout the day. The
main goal of the project is to provide users with tools to control the amount of
water in their bodies, plan, and track their consumption.

The project includes user registration, authentication and verification. It
ensures user security through password encryption and token-based
identification.

The user can calculate the recommended water consumption norm using a
calculator, taking into account their weight and the duration of physically
demanding activities such as sports or other forms of exercise.

view monthly statistics, as well as perform editing and deletion of their
portions.
